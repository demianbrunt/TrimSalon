You are working in the **TrimSalon** repo.

This is an **Angular + TypeScript** app using **Firebase** (Auth/Firestore/Storage/Functions) and **PrimeNG/PrimeFlex/PrimeIcons** (plus FullCalendar for scheduling).

### Code expectations

- Prefer modern Angular patterns (standalone, `inject()`, typed forms, modern control flow `@if/@for/@switch`).
- Keep components/services small and single-responsibility.
- Avoid `any` (prefer `unknown` + narrowing).
- Prefer simple, readable solutions over clever ones.

### UI expectations (PrimeNG)

- Prefer PrimeNG components for consistency.
- Prefer PrimeFlex utilities for layout/spacing; keep custom CSS minimal.

### Non-functional requirements

- Security-first (no secrets in code; validate input; least privilege).
- Accessibility-first (aim for WCAG 2.2 AA; semantic HTML; keyboard support).
- Performance-aware (avoid unnecessary change detection work; avoid heavy template expressions).

### Verification

- After changes: run lint/tests/build as appropriate, and fix any new TypeScript/ESLint errors.
